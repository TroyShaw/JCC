Document contains details on lexing various constants in C

Four main constants in C
    - string
    - char
    - integer
    - floating


Note:
    The C standard also includes enum constants, but these cannot be resolved easily during lexical analysis, so these are considered identifiers.


integer constant
=======

Grammar
-------

integer-constant:
    | decimal-constant integer-suffix(opt)
    | octal-constant integer-suffix(opt)
    | hexadecimal-constant integer_suffix(opt)

decimal-constant:
    | nonzero-digit
    | decimal-constant digit

octal-constant:
    | 0
    | octal-constant octal-digit

hexadecimal-constant:
    | hexadecimal-prefix hexadecimal-digit
    | hexadecimal-constant hexadecimal-digit


hexadecimal-prefix: 0x, 0X
hexadecimal-digit: nonzero-digits, a, b, c, d, e, f, A, B, C, D, E, F
nonzero-digit: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
octal-digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

integer-suffix:
    | unsigned-suffix long-suffix(opt)
    | unsigned-suffix long-long-suffix(opt)
    | long-suffix unsigned-suffix(opt)
    | long-long-suffix unsigned-suffix(opt)

unsigned-suffix: u, U
long-suffix: l, L
long-long-suffix: ll, LL


integer-constant:
    [1-9][0-9]*             int_suffix
    0[0-7]*                 int_suffix
    (0x|0X) [a-zA-Z0-9]+    int_suffix


Explanation
-----------

Basically three forms, base 10, base 7 octal, and base 16 hexidecimal.
Hexidecimal integers start with either 0x or 0X and then have any decimal number or letters a-f or A-F as described above.
Octal integers start with 0, then have any number of 0-7 after that. This means the constant 0 is an octal constant.
Decimal constants are those that are left, start with 1-9, then any number of digits 1-9 after that.

Every integer constant can also have an optional integer suffix, as described in the grammar above.

Valid combinations are:
    u, U, l, L, ll, LL
    ul, uL, Ul, UL
    ull, uLL, Ull, ULL
    lu, lU, Lu, LU
    llu, llU, LLu, LLU


floating constant
=================

Grammar
-------

floating-constant:
    | decimal-floating-constant
    | hexadecimal-floating-constant

    | E sign(opt) digit-sequence

digit-sequence:
    | digit 
    | digit-sequence digit

hexadecimal-fractional-constant:
    | hexadecimal-digit-sequence(opt) . hexadecimal-digit-sequence
    | hexadecimal-digit-sequence .

binary-expression-part:
    | p sign(opt) digit-sequence
    | P sign(opt) digit-sequence

hexadecimal-digit-sequence:
    | hexadecimal-digit
    | hexadecimal-digit-sequence hexadecimal-digit

floating-suffix: f, F, l, L

sign: +, -


Explanation
-----------

The floating constant is reasonably complex.


There are two main cases: base 10 floating constants, and hex floating constants.
First, all constants can have an optional floating-suffix.

For base 10, there are two main cases

fractional-constant [exponent-part]
    [digit-sequence] . digit-sequence [exponent-part]
    digit-sequence . [exponent-part]

digit-sequence exponent-part
    



char constant
=============

Grammar
-------

character-constant:
    | ' c-char-sequence '
    | L' c-char-sequence '

c-char-sequence:
    | c-char
    | c-char-sequence c-char

c-char:
    | any character except ', \, or newline
    | escape-sequence

escape-sequence:
    simple-escape-sequence
    octal-escape-sequence
    hexidecimal-escape-sequence
    universal-character-name

simple-escape-sequence:
    \', \", \?, \\, \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v

octal-escape-sequence:
    | \ octal-digit
    | \ octal-digit octal-digit
    | \ octal-digit octal-digit octal-digit

hexadecimal-escape-sequence:
    | \x hexadecimal-digit
    | hexadecimal-escape-sequence hexadecimal-digit


Description
-----------

A char constant is 1 or more c-chars enclosed in single-quote marks. 
A c-char can be of a few forms:
    - a simple single char, e.g. a, 4, s, etc.
    - an escaped value, e.g. \n, \t, \a, etc.
    - an octal escape value, which is a backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits, e.g. \073, \0, \23, etc.
    - a hexadecimal escape value, which is \x, followed by 1 or more hex digits, e.g. \x28a09Ef, \xabab, \x0, etc.
    - a universal character name, which is \u or \U followed by 4 or 8 hex digits, e.g. \u0AAe, \UDee329AF

There is also a restriction that a c-char cannot be a single-quote ', a newline, or the backslash.

An interesting consequence of this is that the null char '\0' is actually an octal char constant!
Note also char constants can be prefixed with a capital 'L' character to denote it as a wide char constant.

string constant
===============

string-literal:
    | " s-char-sequence(opt) "
    | L" s-char-sequence(opt) "

s-char-sequence:
    | s-char
    | s-char-sequence s-char

s-char:
    | any character except ", \, or newline
    | escape-sequence

A string constant has exactly the same syntax, grammar, etc of a c-char, except with a few changes.
A string constant can be empty, e.g. "", whereas a char constant requires at least one character.

Instead of the restriction being single-quotes, it is now double-quotes.
